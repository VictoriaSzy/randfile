# randfile

Write a c program with the following features:
1. A function that generates a random number by reading in the correct number of bytes from /dev/random.
2. A main function that:
- Populates an array with 10 random numbers generated by your random function (print out each value)
  - If your program seems to stall at this step, it's possible that your computer doesn't have enough entropy and is waiting, you can read from /dev/urandom instead.
- Writes the array to a file
  - Do not use a loop when writing to the file
- Reads that file into a different array
  - Do not use a loop when reading from the file
- Prints out the contents of the second array to verify the random numbers are the same from step 1


Remember to use good practices, like checking return values for errors.
Also remember to include a makefile that includes a separate run target
